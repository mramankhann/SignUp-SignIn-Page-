# 🔐 Sign Up / Sign In Page

Welcome to the **SignUp / SignIn Page** — a stylish and responsive authentication UI built with **⚛️ React.js**, **⚡ Vite**, and **🎨 Tailwind CSS**!

This project focuses on designing clean and user-friendly login and registration forms. It's ideal for practicing **form handling**, **state management**, and building reusable components. While it currently focuses on frontend UI, it's ready for integration with a real backend and JWT authentication.
